# Printing a variable with the (len(variable)) prefix will print the numbers of characters in the variable.
# We can tie this to a limiter that will, for example, prevent the input of an online form exceeding 20 characters.

name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Hi ' + name )
favourite_colour = input('What is your favourite colour?')
print (name + ' likes ' + favourite_colour)
# Variable = userinput takes the user's input and defines it as a variable
# That variable can that be stored and called as a print command
